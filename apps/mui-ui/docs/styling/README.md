# Styling

We are using [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) as our principal file type for
styling the application, we support light and dark mode, you can find [here](https://github.prod.hulu.com/DataPlatform/mcm/blob/develop/apps/mcm-ui/src/components/ThemeSelector/ThemeSelector.tsx)
how we handle the selection.
To handle what colors should we use for each, we have defined global color variables to reuse across the app.

You can find the light theme color variables [here](https://github.prod.hulu.com/DataPlatform/mcm/blob/develop/apps/mcm-ui/src/components/ThemeSelector/DayTheme/variables-day-theme.css) and dark theme ones [here](https://github.prod.hulu.com/DataPlatform/mcm/blob/develop/apps/mcm-ui/src/components/ThemeSelector/DarkTheme/variables-dark-theme.css)
